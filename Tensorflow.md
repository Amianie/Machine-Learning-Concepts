# Introduction To Tensorflow

Tensorflow is an end-to-end opensource platform for machine learning.Tensorflow is a rich system for managing all aspects of a machine learning system however,this class focuses on using a particular TensorFlow API to develop and Train machine learning models.

Tensorflow APIs are arranged hierarchically with the high-level APIs built on the low-level APIs to create and explore machine learning algorithms.In this course I will use a high level API named tf.keras to define and train machine learning models and to make predictions. tf.keras is the TensorFlow variant of the opensource keras API.

The following figure shows the hierarchy of TensorFlow toolkits.

Using tf.keras requires at least a little understanding of the following two open source libraries:
>- NumPy, which simplifies representing arrays and performing linear algebra operations.
>
>- pandas, which provides an easy way to represent datasets in memory.

>## NumPy Tutorial
>
>NumPy is a python library for creating and manipulating matrices, the main data structure used by ML algorithms.Matrices are mathematical objects used to store alues in rows and columns.
>
>Python call matrices lists,NumPy calls them arrays,Tensorflow calls them Tensors.Python represents matrices with the list data type.

>## Pandas Tutorial
>
>Here we are introduced to the Data Frames which are the central Data structures in the Pandas API.
>
>A dataframe is similar to an in-memory spreadsheet.It entails:
>
>- A dataframe store data in cells.
>
>- A dataframe has named columns and numbered rows.
